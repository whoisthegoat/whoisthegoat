        Events beyond our control. McDONALD’S HAS [AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE McDONALD’S SYSTEM HAVE] NO RESPONSIBILITY for McDONALD’S FAILURE TO PERFORM any of ITS obligations under these terms caused by or related to any event beyond McDonald’s reasonable control. If such an event occurs, then McDonald’s obligations under these terms will be suspended for the duration of the event; and McDonald’s may, but is not required to, use reasonable endeavors to find a solution by which its obligations under these terms may be performed despite the event.
        
        In the event of a dispute, the following provisions will apply:
        
            The seat and place of the arbitration shall be the Arab Republic of Egypt.
            The language of the proceedings and award shall be in Arabic.
            The arbitrator’s decision shall be based on these terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that you may have entered into in connection with the online services
            The arbitration award shall be final and binding on both parties and not subject to any appeal.
            No claims shall be arbitrated on a class or representative basis as you and McDonald’s hereby waive the right to assert claims in any class or representative action; arbitration will therefore only decide the individual claims of you and McDonald’s; it is agreed that the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of any other person or party to an arbitration between you and McDonald’s under this provision;
            You and McDonald's empower the arbitrator with the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of these terms or formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any dispute and any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable;
            With the exception of subpart (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules and procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) above is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither McDonald’s nor you shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.  In such event, you agree to bring any and all claims arising out of or related to these terms or the online services in the courts of Arab Republic of Egypt Further, BOTH YOU AND MCDONALD’S AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.  Finally, this arbitration provision is reciprocally binding on all parties, such that both you and McDonald’s are required to arbitrate their claims against one another
            The award shall include the reasonable cost and expenses of the prevailing party incurred in participating in the arbitration including reasonable cost of legal representation.
            Judgement upon the award rendered may be executed by the relevant court of the Arab Republic of Egypt having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial recognition or enforcement of the award as the case may be.
        
         
        
               Apple Applications
        
        These terms incorporate and supplement the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) terms and Conditions (available at http://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html#service), including the Licensed Application End User terms therein (“Apple terms”). If you are using the online services through Apple application (“Apple Application”), you also acknowledge and agree:
        
        • Apple has no obligation at all to provide any support or maintenance services in relation to the Apple Application. If you have any maintenance or support questions in relation to the Apple Apps, please contact McDonald’s, not Apple, using the above Support Services details;
        • except as otherwise expressly set out in these terms, any claims relating to the possession or use of the Apple Application are between you and McDonald’s (and not between you, or anyone else, and Apple); and
        • in the event of any claim by a third party that your possession or use (in accordance with these terms) of the Apple Application infringes any intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible or liable to you in relation to that claim;
        
         
        
        If the Apple Application that you have purchased does not conform to any warranty applying to it, you may notify Apple, which may refund the purchase price of the Apple Application to you subject to then-current Apple terms and conditions. Subject to that, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple does not give or enter into any warranty, condition or other term in relation to the Apple Application and will not be liable to you for any claims, losses, costs or expenses of whatever nature in relation to the Apple Application or as a result of you or anyone else using the Apple Application or relying on any of its content.
        
         
        
                Miscellaneous.
        
                     McDonald's makes no representation that the online services are appropriate or available outside of Egypt. If you use the online services from other locations you are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. 
                     These terms will be governed and interpreted pursuant to the laws of Egypt, notwithstanding any principles of conflicts of law.
                     Although these terms govern the online services as between McDonald’s and you only (and although Apple is not a party to [, and no other Members of the McDonald’s System are parties to, ] these terms), Apple [and other Members of the McDonald’s System] are third party beneficiaries under these terms and will have the right to enforce against you those rights that McDonald’s holds under these terms to the extent such terms may pertain to them; there are no other third beneficiaries under these terms.
                     The terms are written in English and Arabic. Any translation of the terms into another language is provided solely for your convenience, and to the extent there is any conflict between the two, the English version controls.
                     Each of the terms and conditions in these terms are severable and operate separately. If any of them are unlawful, void or unenforceable, then the remaining terms and conditions will remain in full force and effect.
                     If McDonald’s fails to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms, or if McDonald’s does not enforce its rights against you, or delays in doing so, that will not mean that McDonald’s has waived its rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations.
                     McDonald’s may transfer its rights and obligations under these terms to another organization or entity, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms. You may only transfer your rights or obligations under these terms to another person if McDonald’s agrees in writing.
        
            On termination of these terms or of your permission to use the online services, all rights granted to you under terms shall cease; however, these terms will continue to apply to your prior use of the online services and anything relating to or arising from such use. Upon termination, all of rights of McDonald’s and other Members of the McDonald’s System, including all intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, and licenses in these terms shall survive, as well all restrictions on use, all limitations on liability and disclaimers, and all of Section 9 (“How we settle disputes”).

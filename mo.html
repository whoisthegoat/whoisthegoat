       <div> <h2 id="f">  Mohamed Salah </h2>
            Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly born 15 June 1992, also known as Mo Salah, is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Considered one of the best players in the world and amongst the greatest African players of all time, he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.
<br>
            Salah started his senior career in 2010 playing for Al Mokawloon, departing in 2012 to join Basel, where he won two Swiss Super League titles. In 2014, Salah joined Chelsea for a reported fee of £11 million, but limited gametime led to successive loans to Fiorentina and Roma, who later signed him permanently for €15 million. In the 2016–17 season, Salah was a key figure in Roma's unsuccessful title bid, reaching double figures in both goals and assists.[19]
            <br>
            In 2017, Salah signed for Liverpool for a then-club record transfer of £36.9 million. In his first season, he set the record for most Premier League goals scored (32) in a 38-game season and helped Liverpool to the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final. Salah went on to be an integral player in the club's Champions League and Premier League title successes the following two seasons, and has since also won the FA Cup and the League Cup. Salah has achieved numerous individual accolades, including two PFA Players' Player of the Year awards, three Premier League Golden Boots, the Premier League Player of the Season, the Premier League Playmaker of the Season, and finished third for the Best FIFA Men's Player in 2018 and 2021. He received the 2018 FIFA Puskás Award for his winning strike in the first Merseyside derby of the 2017–18 season. In 2023, Salah became Liverpool's Premier League top goalscorer surpassing Robbie Fowler.[20]
            <br>
            At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. Since then, he finished as runner-up in the 2017 and 2021 Africa Cup of Nations and was top scorer during CAF qualification as Egypt qualified for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah was named CAF African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament, 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions.
            <br>
            Outside of football, Salah is regarded as a symbol of national pride in Egypt for his achievements[21][22] and was named in Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential people in 2019.[23] Salah has also been credited for raising the profile of Liverpool among Egyptians.[24][25]

           <h2 class="1">Club career</h2> 
          <div><h2 id="x">Al Mokawloon</h2> 
            <h3>2006–10: Youth teams</h3>
            Salah started out playing for local youth teams. He names Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and Francesco Totti as his childhood idols.[26] In 2006, he joined the youth team of Al Mokawloon aged 14 after being spotted by a scout who had originally come to watch another child play but was distracted by Salah.[27][28] Salah frequently had to miss school to make the 3 hour journey to training.[26] When Salah was 15 he was noticed by then first team manager Mohamed Radwan, who moved him to the senior squad immediately. Salah had to be given a special diet and training program due to his muscles not being fully formed because of his young age.[29]
            
           <h3>2010–12: Senior team appearances</h3> 
            Salah made his senior team debut in the Egyptian Premier League coming on as a substitute on 3 May 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against El Mansoura. During the 2010–11 season Salah continued earning minutes on the pitch, eventually becoming a regular in the team.[27] Even though he was getting regular game time, Salah struggled to score. In the dressing room after matches he would sometimes be in tears because of this, and Radwan says it only motivated him to become better.[28] He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 in a 1–1 away draw against Al Ahly.[30] He remained a regular for Al Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the 2011–12 season.[31][32] Following the Port Said Stadium riot on 1 February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League was suspended, and on 10 March 2012, the Egyptian Football Association announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.[33]

          <div> <h2 id="b">Basel</h2>
           <h3>2012–13: Development and breakthrough</h3> 
            
            Salah playing for Basel away at Zenit St Petersburg in the UEFA Europa League in March 2013
            Swiss Super League club Basel had been monitoring Salah for some time,[34] so following the Egyptian Premier League suspension, the club organised a friendly match with the Egypt U-23 team.[35] The match took place on 16 March at the Stadion Rankhof in Basel, and despite only playing the second half, Salah scored twice, helping the Egyptians to a 4–3 win.[36] Basel subsequently invited Salah to remain in the city for a week's training. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that Salah had signed for Basel on a four-year contract starting from 15 June 2012.[37][38][39] He initially found it difficult to settle, having arrived unable to speak the language and been signed as a replacement for fan-favourite Xherdan Shaqiri (whom he would later play alongside at Liverpool).[40] Salah scored on his unofficial debut on 23 June 2012 against Steaua București during a friendly match, a 4–2 defeat.[41] He made his official Basel debut in a UEFA Champions League preliminary stage match against the Norwegian club Molde on 8 August, coming on as a substitute in the 74th minute.[42] He made his league debut on 12 August against Thun, playing the full match.[43]
            <br>
            He scored his first league goal a week later, the second goal in the 2–0 home win against Lausanne.[44] Salah scored his first Europa League goal in the quarter-finals on 11 April 2013, as Basel advanced to the semi-finals by beating Tottenham Hotspur 4–1 on penalties after a 4–4 aggregate draw.[45] In the semi-final on 2 May, Salah scored against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, although they were beaten 5–2 on aggregate.[46] Despite late disappointment in Europe, Basel comfortably won the Swiss Super League season 2012–13 Championship title[47] and finished runners-up in the Swiss Cup.[48]
            <br>
            <h3>2013–14: Final season and league championship</h3>
            Ahead of the 2013–14 Swiss Super League season, Salah was a member of the Basel team that won the 2013 Uhrencup.[49] Salah scored in his first league appearance of the season against Aarau on 13 July 2013.[50] He scored his first Champions League goal a month later against Maccabi Tel Aviv on 6 August 2013 in the third qualifying round.[51] Salah was the subject of major controversy following the game, after he appeared to deliberately avoid shaking hands with the players of the Israeli club in both the home and away legs.[52]
            <br>
            He scored twice against the Bulgarian league champions PFC Ludogorets Razgrad on 21 August 2013 in the play-off round.[53] On 18 September 2013, Salah scored the equaliser against Chelsea in the 2–1 away win during the group stage. During the return tie on 26 November at the St. Jakob-Park, Salah scored the winning goal as Basel beat Chelsea for the second time with a 1–0 home win.[54] However he was unable to prevent Basel being eliminated in the group stage.[55]
            <br>
            On the domestic stage, Salah continued to perform. Scoring 4 goals in 18 games,[56] including a double against title rivals Young Boys,[57] he helped Basel win the league title for the fifth time in a row.[58]
            <br>
            On 23 January 2014 it was announced that Salah would leave Basel.[59] During his time with the club, Salah played a total of 95 games for Basel scoring a total of 21 goals. 47 of these games were in the Swiss Super League, six in the Swiss Cup, 26 in the UEFA competitions (Champions League and Europa League) and 16 were friendly games. He scored nine goals in the domestic league, four in the cup, seven in the European games and the other was scored during the test games.[60]
        </div><hr>
           <div><h2 id="p">Chelsea</h2>
           <h3>2013–14: Entry into first-team squad</h3>
            On 23 January 2014, Chelsea announced that a deal had been agreed with Basel to sign Salah for a fee reported to be in the region of £11 million.[61] Three days later the transfer was completed, making him the first Egyptian to sign for the London-based club.[62] Liverpool had been keen to sign the Basel striker, and had made an offer of £11 million but were beaten to his signature by the Blues.[63]
            <br>
            On 8 February, Salah made his debut for Chelsea in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in the 3–0 win over Newcastle United.[64] Seven games later, on 22 March, Salah scored his first goal for Chelsea against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge in the London Derby, coming on as a substitute for Oscar, in a match which ended with a 6–0 win for the Blues.[65] Then, on 5 April, Salah opened the scoring and later won a penalty and assisted the third goal in Chelsea's 3–0 win over Stoke City.[66]
            
           <h3>2014–15: Domestic success</h3> 
            
           
            <br>
            Before the 2014–15 season, Salah's future with Chelsea looked to be in doubt after reports suggested he could be forced to return to Egypt to carry out military service after his registration for an education scheme was rescinded by the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education.[67] He was spared of military service after a meeting with the then Egyptian prime minister Ibrahim Mahlab, the Minister of Higher Education and the Egyptian national manager Shawky Gharieb.[68] Salah changed squad numbers from 15 to 17 for the start of the season, with his new number having been vacated by Eden Hazard changing to number 10.[69]
            <br>
            Salah was rarely used during the season, making just three Premier League, two UEFA Champions League and three cup appearances, failing to score in any of them. On 28 October 2014, after a poor performance in a 2–1 win at League Two club Shrewsbury Town in the fourth round of the League Cup, he and fellow winger André Schürrle were criticized publicly by manager José Mourinho.[70] Although Salah only made three league appearances before his loan move to Fiorentina, Mourinho stated that he would receive a replica winner's medal from the club for his contributions that season.[71]
            <hr>
            <h2 id="i">2015: Loan to Fiorentina</h2>
            On the transfer deadline day, 2 February 2015, Chelsea confirmed that Salah would join Italian club Fiorentina on an 18-month loan until the end of the 2015–16 season, as part of a transfer deal which saw Juan Cuadrado moving in the opposite direction. Six days after signing, he made his Fiorentina debut coming off the bench in the 65th minute as a replacement for Joaquín in a 3–2 Serie A victory against Atalanta at the Stadio Artemio Franchi.[72] Salah chose the number 74 shirt in honor of the victims of the Port Said Stadium riot.[73][74][75]
            
            <br>
           
            Salah made his first start for Fiorentina on 14 February against Sassuolo, scoring his first goal for the club in the 30th minute. He then provided an assist to Khouma Babacar just two minutes after scoring; the match ended in a 3–1 win for Fiorentina.[76] Twelve days later, Salah scored his first European goal for Fiorentina, as his side advanced to the round of 16 of the Europa League, beating Tottenham 3–1 on aggregate.[77][78] Salah scored the winning goal for Fiorentina against Inter Milan on 1 March, his third goal in Serie A.[79] Four days after that, Salah scored both of Fiorentina's goals in their 2–1 win away to Juventus in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg.[80] At the end of the season, Fiorentina activated an option to make the loan move permanent, but Salah refused the move. Even though the loan agreement was for 18 months, Salah refused to return to Fiorentina and instead joined fellow Serie A club Roma.[81][82] On 11 September, Fiorentina filed a complaint to FIFA, claiming that Chelsea had breached the agreed contract when they allowed Salah to join Roma on loan.[83] The Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Salah and Chelsea of any wrongdoing.[84]

           <h3 id="r">2015–16: Loan to Roma</h3>

In his return, Salah was also sent off after picking up a second yellow in the closing minutes of the match, just seconds after picking up his first yellow.[93][94] On 4 November, he scored the opening goal of a 3–2 Champions League win over Bayer Leverkusen.[95]
            <br>
            On 4 March, he faced his former side Fiorentina again and scored another double as Roma won 4–1 and broke into the top three.[96] Salah would go onto score another three goals that season, scoring against Bologna, Genoa, and AC Milan, the latter on the final day.[97][98][99] In the 2015–16 season, Salah scored 15 goals in 42 matches as Roma finished in third place in Serie A and qualified for the Champions League.[100] In June, it was announced that Salah won the club's 2015–16 Player of the Season award.[101]

In this game, he also broke a record of scoring 36 times in his debut season for Liverpool, and also became the leading goalscorer in Europe's top five leagues – overtaking Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Tottenham striker Harry Kane. Following Salah's record-breaking goal exploits former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard stated "we are witnessing the start of greatness".[128]
            <br>
            “What a season. And more to come in the Champions League and World Cup. It's been great to watch you.” — Pelé to Salah on his record-breaking 2017-2018 season.[129]

In doing so, he simultaneously became the first player from Africa and the first Liverpool player to score 10 goals in a single campaign in the tournament. His double also took him to 43 goals for the season across all competitions, surpassing Roger Hunt's tally of 42, and making him Liverpool's second-highest goalscorer in a single season, behind Ian Rush.[133] He had previously also broken the club's record for the Premier League era, surpassing Robbie Fowler's total of 36 goals set in the 1995–96 campaign, and Fernando Torres' record of 33 for the most goals by a Liverpool player in a debut season.[134] After his two goals and assists in the first leg against Roma, Salah featured in the second leg as Liverpool beat Roma 7–6 on aggregate to qualify for the final for the first time in eleven years.[135] He would then become the Premier League's all-time goalscorer for a 38-game season, registering his 32nd league goal in a 4–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion en route to being awarded the Premier League Golden Boot.[136]
            <br>
            In the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final against Real Madrid, Salah injured his left shoulder in the 30th minute after a challenge by Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.[137] After initially carrying on, he left the field in tears after going to ground again;[138] the match ended in a 3–1 defeat. The Egyptian FA stated that this would have no effect on his playing at the 2018 World Cup in Russia and that Salah would still be named in the team's final squad on 4 June.[139] The day after the match, Ramos wrote a message and sent him good wishes.[140]

            In February 2019, West Ham said they were investigating a video which allegedly showed fans racially abusing Salah, including for being Muslim. The investigation resulted in the fan being banned for three years. On 5 April, he scored his 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool in a 3–1 win over Southampton and in the process broke Torres' record to become the fastest player to reach the milestone for the club, doing so in his 69th appearance.[165] It also saw him become the third fastest player to reach the milestone for a single club in the Premier League era, behind Shearer for Blackburn Rovers, in 66 appearances, and Van Nistelrooy for Manchester United, in 68 appearances.[166] Later that month, he scored the second goal, a powerful strike from 25 yards out that flew into the top corner, in a 2–0 win over Chelsea which helped Liverpool earn a club-record-equaling 26th win for the Premier League campaign; and the club's second-highest ever wins return in the top-flight after the record of 30 set in 1979.[167] On 26 April, he made his 100th appearance for Liverpool and broke the record jointly held by Roger Hunt and Sam Raybould for the player with the most goals in his first century of appearances for the club, netting twice in a 5–0 win over Huddersfield Town to take his tally to 69.[168]

Salah did not play in this second round owing to injury, however, Liverpool managed to win the game 4-0, thus going through to the final.

            On 19 January 2020, Salah scored his first goal in five encounters against rivals Manchester United with a run that spanned from outside his box to the other goal in Liverpool's 2–0 win at Anfield in the Premier League. On 29 January, Salah scored Liverpool's opening goal in a 2–0 win at West Ham, a victory that saw the club beat every team in a Premier League season – the first time in the club's 127-year history that they had accomplished it in the top-flight. On 7 March, Salah scored the opening goal in a 2–1 win against Bournemouth as Liverpool made it an English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home wins. It was also his 70th Premier League goal in 100 appearances for Liverpool, meaning that he had scored seven more goals than the previous best in their first 100 league games for the club (63 goals by Fernando Torres).[181] Salah's 20th of the season saw him become the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals in all competitions in three consecutive seasons since Michael Owen between 2000–01 and 2002–03.[182]

            On 31 January 2021, Salah scored two goals against West Ham and became the fifth Liverpool player to score more than 20 goals in all competitions in four consecutive seasons, and the first since Ian Rush did so six times running from 1981–82 to 1986–87.

On 24 April, he scored in a 1–1 draw with Newcastle United, to become the first Liverpool player to score 20 goals in three different Premier League campaigns. On 13 May, he scored a goal in a 4–2 away win over Manchester United, to be his team's first away win at Old Trafford since March 2014. Moreover, he also became the only player to score at Old Trafford for Liverpool in two different games in a season, having scored twice in a 3–2 defeat in the FA Cup, since Harry Chambers in the 1920–21 season.
